    <h1>About Me</h1>
    
    <p>Hi, I'm <strong>Jada Holloway</strong>, a passionate software developer with a strong focus on building scalable solutions. I specialize in <strong>Java</strong>, <strong>Python</strong>, <strong>JavaScript</strong>, and <strong>Test-Driven Development (TDD)</strong>, always striving to write clean, efficient, and reliable code.</p>

    <p>Currently, I'm diving deep into <strong>Spring Boot</strong> and <strong>AWS</strong>, aiming to get certified as a <strong>Spring Boot Developer</strong> and <strong>AWS Cloud Practitioner</strong>. These technologies are a key part of my growth as I work to build robust, cloud-native applications.</p>

    <p>Over the years, I’ve had the opportunity to work on many scalable projects, including participating in <strong>hackathons</strong> where I collaborated with diverse teams to solve complex problems in a short time frame.</p>

    <p>When I’m not coding, you can find me <strong>gardening</strong>, <strong>cooking</strong>, or exploring the world of <strong>pottery</strong>—a hobby I’m excited to get started with soon. These activities help me maintain a balanced and creative lifestyle.</p>

    <p>I am also <strong>Java Foundation certified</strong>, and proficient in several programming languages, including <strong>Python</strong>, <strong>C++</strong>, <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong>, and <strong>JavaScript</strong>. I am always learning and eager to explore new technologies that can improve both my skills and the projects I work on.</p>

    <p>Feel free to reach out to me if you’d like to collaborate, chat about tech, or exchange ideas.</p>
