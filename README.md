<h1>About Me<h1>
Hi, I'm Jada Holloway, a passionate software developer with a strong focus on building scalable solutions. I specialize in Java, Python, JavaScript, and Test-Driven Development (TDD), always striving to write clean, efficient, and reliable code.

Currently, I'm diving deep into Spring Boot and AWS, aiming to get certified as a Spring Boot Developer and AWS Cloud Practitioner. These technologies are a key part of my growth as I work to build robust, cloud-native applications.

Over the years, I’ve had the opportunity to work on many scalable projects, including participating in hackathons where I collaborated with diverse teams to solve complex problems in a short time frame.

When I’m not coding, you can find me gardening, cooking, or exploring the world of pottery—a hobby I’m excited to get started with soon. These activities help me maintain a balanced and creative lifestyle.

I am also Java Foundation certified, and proficient in several programming languages, including Python, C++, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I am always learning and eager to explore new technologies that can improve both my skills and the projects I work on.

Feel free to reach out to me if you’d like to collaborate, chat about tech, or exchange ideas.
